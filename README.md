# Luis O. Rodriguez Sanabria
I am a dedicated and analytical professional with hands-on experience in data science, software development, and process operations. With a background in agriculture and a growing portfolio of machine learning, data analysis, and visualization projects, I bring a unique perspective to solving real-world problems with data-driven solutions.

Recently, I completed an intensive Data Science Bootcamp, where I developed expertise in:
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, SQL, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow and PyTorch
- Data cleaning, feature engineering, and model evaluation
- Building dashboards and visual insights using Power BI and Matplotlib
- Large language models and process optimization
- End-to-end project development including ETL, machine learning pipelines, and reporting

I have applied these skills in projects that forecast trends, automate workflows, and generate actionable insights from complex and large scale datasets. My professional role at Bayer Crop Science has taught me the value of precision, quality control, and systems thinking—lessons I carry into every line of code I write.

I am currently seeking a full-time data science or analytics position where I can continue growing, contribute to meaningful projects, and be part of a team that values curiosity, continuous learning, and innovation.

Let’s connect if you are looking for someone who is technically skilled, highly motivated, and ready to turn data into impact to solve your operational needs.
